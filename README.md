Just tiny projects that I make in each link on the site. This is where I mess around with React.

## Lessons learned / mistakes I made
- **Make future apps more modular -** I spilled a lot of code in the app file that should have been in components. I wanted to fix this but since this is a playground project, I thought it would be too time consuming.
- **Keep context api in seperate file -** The theme context api should have also been in a seperate file, I didn't know you could do that until it was alread implemented.
- **Organize CSS beforehand -** The CSS didn't get too crazy because this project is small, but it was getting a little hairy as I went on. I found out there are many methods to organize CSS in a project beforehand and will be planning ahead next time.
